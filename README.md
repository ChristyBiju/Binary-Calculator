# Binary Calculator
Binary calculator implemented using linked list and stack data structures to handle arithmetic operations on large binary numbers.

## Description
* This project is a Command-line Arbitrary Precision Calculator implemented in C, inspired by the Unix-based command 'bc'.
* The calculator is designed to perform operations on infinite numbers, allowing for calculations with extremely large numbers.

### Operations which can be performed :
* '+' : Addition
* '-' : Subtraction
* '*' : Multiplication
* '/' : Division
* '%' : Modulo
* '^' : Power
  
<hr>

* Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations are supported.
* Precedence Handling: Expressions are evaluated according to their precedence using parentheses.
* Arbitrary Precision: The calculator handles numbers with arbitrary precision by utilizing linked list and stack data structures.
